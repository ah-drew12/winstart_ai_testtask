Hello, in this readme file i will tell you how to run the notebook on your device.

1. The first thing to do is to install all libraries from requirements.txt. 

2. After that you should not download any dataset because load_digits() should be available after installing scikit-learn library.

3. Now you can run all models in notebook and see the results by yourself.


Good luck deploying and experimenting with this notebook!
